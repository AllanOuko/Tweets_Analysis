# Tweets_Analysis

* Twitter is a rich place where people keep updated with trending topics and news. The recent Russian-Ukraine conflict has elicited mixed reactions about the direction of the war.
* In this project, I used the R package (rtweet) to extract real-time data from twitter.
* The project’s aim was to conduct sentiment analysis on the Russian-Ukraine conflict. I limited the search to the last 10,000 tweets by using ‘Russia’ and ‘Ukraine’ as the key words.
* I performed some data cleaning and conducted unigram sentiment analysis to find thee positive and negative words in the selected tweets.
* Furthermore, I analyzed the sentiments expressed by both President Biden and President Putin on the issue.
* I extracted the last 10,000 tweets from both and maintained the codes for cleaning and manipulating the text.

# Update
* One needs to access Twitter API to access Twitter and run the code.
